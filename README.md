## Health Partners Fizz Buzz Coding Test

This is a simple C# .NET 9 Console application, designed to meet standard FizzBuzz requirements:

Take a list of numbers and for each number, if it is divisible by 3 it should output "Fizz", if divisible by 5, "Buzz", and if divisible by both 3 and 5, then the output should read "FizzBuzz".

The requirements state that a fixed range of 1-100 should be used as the input, and output should be written to a console window.

There are two projects in the Solution - the main program and an NUnit unit test project. Both should be runnable from any .NET-aware IDE, such as Rider or Visual Studio.
